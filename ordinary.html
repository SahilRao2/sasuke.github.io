		<strong>sharingan</strong>
		
		As soon as an Uchiha awakens the Sharingan , his abilities of Sharingan will be in a basic state and consists of One tomoe. However the Basic Sharingan has the ability to see chakra flow ( not so precise information like byakugan ) and can also see clearly if the opponent has speed in his side.<br>
 
    </p>

<p><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\uchiha\evolve.jpg"><br>
	 <strong>Mangekyo Sharingan:</strong> An evolved form of Basic Sharingan. Mangekyo is obtained when an Uchiha is in a trauma of losing the closest ones.
     
</p>
	
<p>
	<img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\uchiha\1234.gif"><br>
 <strong>Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan:</strong> 3rd stage of Sharingan is EMS. When a person is transplanted with Mangekyo of an individual with a Bloodline or a close ties , it gives rise to EMS . If the transplanted Mangekyo is from an individual in a Bloodline , it is seen that the Quality and powers will be supported very strongly.

</p>

<p>
	 <img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\uchiha\new_cool.jpg"><br>
	<strong>Rinne-sharingan:</strong> The final evolved form of Sharingan is Rinnegan . Haguromo is the only one to evolve his EMS into Rinnegan. However Sasuke got it by receiving half the powers of Haguromo in THE SHINOBI WAR .

	<h2>Sasuke Power's</h2>
	<div id=first><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\uchiha\sauske.jpg"  alt="kid sasuke uchiha">
<p>	Sasuke Uchiha is so strong that he could take on entire shinobi world and he has many abilites.</p></div>
<p><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\uchiha\fireball.gif"><br>
	<strong>Fire style Ninjutsu.</strong> <br>The Uchiha excel at this. Their signature jutsu is Grand Fireball. Sasuke mastered this at a very young age<br></p>

<p><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\uchiha\shuriken.gif"><br>
	<strong>Shuriken jutsu.</strong><br> Sasuke aimed to be better than Itachi, whose skills impressed even the ANBU black ops squad. Needless to say he was one of the best at Shuriken Jutsu.<br>
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Sharingan.</strong><br> Most Uchiha have this Kekei Genkai. It allows them to rapidly follow and react to an opponent's movement, read their Chakra flow, and cast powerful Genjutsu. It also allows one to learn Ninjutsu after watching it being performed once.
Sasuke Sharingan was so skilled that he could see through the genjutsu of the <dfn title="He was weak">Itachi's</dfn> and can even look into the memomry of other's people. Skilled Uchiha's could even control the tailed beast with their sharingan.
<br>
<img src="C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/uchiha/inferno.gif"><br>
<strong>All Mangekyo sharingan has unique ability's.</strong><br>His Mangekyo Sharingan and Eternal Mangekyo sharingan were so skilled even Madara Uchiha remarked him. he could make Susano and Could control the Amatarsu(eternal flame).With his left Mangekyou he can cast Amaterasu.
With his right Mangekyou he can shape the flames or extinguish them.<br>
</p>


<p><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\uchiha\chidori.jpg"><br>
	<strong>Lightning Style Ninjutsu.</strong><br> In preparation for his match with Gaara, Kakashi taught him the Chidori, a powerful piercing Jutsu meant to penetrate Gaara's defense. Since then, his Lightning style has improved and he is able to stream and extend lightning style Chakra.He could use chidori with combining with amatarsu(deadly combination) <br>
</p>

<p><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\uchiha\thaijutsu.gif"><br>
	<strong>Taijutstu.</strong><br> A powerhouse long before his encounter with Rock Lee, after copying Lee's taijutstu, sasuke became a very fast and hard hitter.
</p>

<p><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\uchiha\orochimaru.jpg"><br>
	<strong>Orochimaru's special training.</strong><br> In his three year gap, intense training and experimentation made Sasuke strong enough to fight Sai, Yamato and a weakened Naruto at once. He even gained the ability to look into Naruto's psyche and notice the presence of Kyuubi.
</p>

<p><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\uchiha\kirin.gif"><br>
	<strong>Kirin.</strong><br> He gained the ability to gather lightning in the atmosphere for a very powerful, one hit strike which couldn't be avoided. He only showed this against Itachi.
Substitution Jutsu. He used Orochimaru's substitution Jutsu once, in an attempt to catch Itachi off guard.
</p>

<p><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\uchiha\c.jpg"><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\uchiha\arrow.gif"><br>
	<strong>Susanoo.</strong><br> With his Mangekyo sharingan ability, he has a perfect defense and attacking shield
that is called Susanoo. Although it takes a lot much chakra but no one can penetrate the Susano.All Susanoo has special ability like Madara could multiply the Susanoo and Itachi could seal can soul with his Susanoo ability and Sasuke could throw an arrow which is very fast and lethal.
</p>

<p><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\uchiha\curse2.jpg"><br>
	<strong>Curse mark.</strong><br> Juugo's curse mark helped Sasuke get stronger and faster when active. It was removed by Itachi.
Amaterasu. First implanted in his eye by Itachi, he gained it naturally when his own Mangekyo awoke. His right eye could ignite the flames and his left could control them, resulting in an Amaterasu that far exceeded Itachi's in precision.
Susano'o. This colossal giant jutsu which was proof of a double Mangekyo became Sasuke's strongest Jutsu. It took the form of a violet giant with an arm mounted bow which would fire powerful arrows at mid range. In the last battle it even gained wings for flight.
</p>



<p><img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\uchiha\best2.gif"><br>
	<strong>Rinnegan.</strong><br> The Sage of the Six Paths granted him a Rinnegan in one eye that still maintains its tomoe patterns. It quickly exhausts his Chakra so he keeps it closed or deactivated when not in use. It allows him to withstand the Infinite Tsukuyomi. And he can touch Madara's black receivers without suffering any harm. He can also use a space time Ninjutsu which allows him to shift objects and people a set distance from himself. He was able to subdue all beasts at once. He has also used Chibaku Tensei, and can probably use all powers associated with the Rinnegan. He could absorb the chakra
